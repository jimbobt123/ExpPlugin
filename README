#ExpPlugin by Jimbobt123
#V1.1

This plugin allows you to manually edit the EXP drop of any mob via a config file. To use it, simply drag it to
you plugins folder, reload your server to let the config file generate, and then edit the number by the mob
you want to edit. If you make the number too high, instead of dropping that number of orbs, it will drop a few
large orbs.
